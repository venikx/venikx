# Howdy, I'm Kevin ðŸ¤ 

I'm an experienced **Full-Stack Web Developer**, based in the cold, but
beautiful [Helsinki, Finland][1]. Currently I'm **looking for contract work** as
an **independent** full-stack developer, but open to employment for the right
company.

- why you'd hire me: Typescript, Next.js (React.js), AWS, NodeJS, Postgres,
  HTMX, D3.js, Astro
- always talking about: photography, NixOS, gaming, Emacs, my homelab
- learning: graphics programming (no, it's not going well), golang (noice)
